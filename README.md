# node-stonk

A service that buys and sells stonks to automate losing money.

## Getting Started

You will need to provide your own brokerage API key. At the time of creating this service, I used TD Ameritrade's Developer API.

node-stonk currently doesn't support other brokerage APIs.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and copy the contents off the `common.env` file into it, making sure to replace all `FILL_ME_IN` variables.
